# Tiny C Projects

This repo contains tiny projects that explore a concept, pattern, or idea in the most minimal form, while still being generally applicable.

They aren't intended for drop-in production use, and aren't intended to cover every possible use/edge case. Each project should contain a `readme.md` explaining the idea and motivation.

## Projects

- [State Machine](./state-machine): A simple library for implementing event driven state machines
- [FIFO Queue](./thread-fifo): A circular fifo buffer and accompanying operations that can be used to communicate between threads
- [Stretchy Buffers (aka Vectors)](./stretchy-buffers): An implementation of automatically resizable array that does not have a predefined or fixed size
- [Creative Dereferencing](./deref/): A mini exploration of some of the interesting ways you can dereference a pointer
